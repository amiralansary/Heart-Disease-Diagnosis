## Main Task
1. Classify patients with heart failure
2. Identify correlated features

### Approach (options)
1. **Predictive model**
    - Use a predictive model to classify patients who have heart failure 
    - Evaluate the performance of your model and suggest which features may be useful in heart failure prediction
2. **Statistical learning** 
    - Use statistical learning (with or without dimensionality reduction) to identify the combination of feature that 
    are more likely to be associated with heart failure
    - Based on your analysis, suggest which features may be useful to predict heart failure
3. **Causal inference**
    - Use causal inference to identify the features that are more likely to have a causal connection with heart failure
    - Based on your analysis, suggest which features may be useful to predict heart failure
4. **Other approach**
    - If you would prefer not to apply the suggested approaches, then build another form of predictive/statistical 
    model that will identify relevant features. *Surprise us!*

### Solution File
Report (no more than 2 pages including plots):
1. outlining and justifying your choice of pre-processing 
2. steps you may have taken to avoid overfitting
3. parameter choices and your choice of classifier / statistical modelling compared to other approaches 
4. What can you conclude from this analysis?

If your model is time consuming to train, then please provide the model as well
